Miscellaneous Projects

This repository has scripts I've written for random projects over the years. 

I wrote the duplicate_removal script to screen out duplicate articles when we were doing a meta-analysis. 

I wrote the Titanic script as a class project. 

The Irish_electricity script was also a class project. 

I wrote the voter_list project to help decide which registered voters my dad's campaign should send mail to.
